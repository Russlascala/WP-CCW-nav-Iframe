                                If you drive an older vehicle or a vehicle with an expired manufacturer’s warranty, you will probably benefit from buying
                                a Vehicle Service Contract. Manufacturer’s warranties typically cover 3 to 4 years, on average. Chances are, if you’ve
                                owned your vehicle for over 3 years, your warranty is either expired or is about to expire. Now is the best time to look
                                into a Vehicle Service Contract.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You wouldn’t wait until after your health insurance has expired to look into finding new coverage would you? It’s
                                crucial, especially if you own an older or used vehicle, that you maintain coverage on your car. The average
                                transmission lasts 7 years or about 100,000 miles and costs anywhere between $2,000 and $6,000. That’s an expensive risk
                                to take in terms of not being covered.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Once you hit 100,000 miles, only the main components of your vehicle are covered. If you drive the average 15,000 miles
                                a year and your manufacturer’s warranty is a 4 year program, you’ll be at 60,000 miles by the time that program ends. If
                                you purchase a 4 year Vehicle Service Contract, you’ll have peace of mind until you’re well past that crucial 100,000
                                mile mark.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Locking in a 3-4 year contract before you hit 100,000 miles is important, if possible. As your mileage goes up, your
                                vehicle qualifies for less coverage. If you know that your manufacturer’s warranty is expiring soon, it’s best to extend
                                it through a VSC before it does. By extending your coverage while your vehicle is still under warranty, you’ll have a
                                much better chance to get the best program available because the Administrator knows that there is nothing currently
                                wrong with your vehicle.

                                    You’re probably wondering what the difference is between a dealership warranty and a Vehicle Service Contract is,
                                    because they’re often used interchangeably. A dealership warranty is what is offered by your car’s dealer or
                                    manufacturer and it covers your vehicle for 3-4 years on average. A dealership warranty is often pretty comprehensive,
                                    because the vehicle will have lower mileage and no pre-existing conditions before it ends up in your hands.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    A Vehicle Service Contract is what you buy from an third party administrator, not the dealer or manufacturer. A Vehicle
                                    Service Contract will generally cover similar components as a dealership warranty, but as your mileage goes up, the
                                    coverage goes down. This is why it’s important to look into purchasing a Vehicle Service Contract before your
                                    manufacturer’s warranty expires. Any lapse in coverage can mean that you’re stuck paying out of pocket for failed
                                    components while you’re still in the validation period to extend your coverage.

                                    When you purchase a Vehicle Service Contract, there is a short waiting period called the Validation Period. This period
                                    is good for the Administrator as well as the consumer. The Validation Period is a 30 day and 1,000 mile waiting period
                                    before you can use your Vehicle Service Contract. This period allows the Administrator to determine that there are no
                                    pre-existing conditions with your vehicle or any of its components. You cannot file a claim within this period and
                                    claims filed right after the Validation Period will generally be subject to an inspection.

                                    The Validation Period also serves as a review period for the consumer. If you review your paperwork and are unhappy with
                                    the contract for any reason, you can cancel for a full refund within the first 30 days. It is important to review the
                                    contract during this period so that you fully understand the terms. After the Validation Period, you can still cancel
                                    your Vehicle Service Contract at any time, but you will only receive a prorated refund based off of time and mileage
                                    used.

                                One of the most common questions we get is people wanting to know what happens to their Vehicle Service Contract if they
                                decide to sell their vehicle. Luckily, this is one of the best aspects of having a VSC for your vehicle. All Vehicle
                                Service Contracts are pro-rated and completely transferable, so if you decide to cancel or sell your car, you have a few
                                flexible options.

                                First of all, having an active Vehicle Service Contract can significantly increase the resale value of your vehicle. The
                                buyer has peace of mind that there is nothing wrong with the car, because it’s under contract. Your car will be easier
                                to sell and will hold its value much better than if if wasn’t protected with a Vehicle Service Contract.

                                If you do decide to sell your vehicle while it is still covered, you have the option of transferring the contract to the
                                buyer. The buyer will receive the same great coverage and you will no longer be responsible for the contract. The second
                                option is canceling the contract and receiving a prorated discount based off of time and miles used. You may also be
                                subject to a small administrative fee which may lessen the amount of your refund. Remember to always refer to the terms
                                and conditions of your contract that you received shortly after your purchase.

                                To answer this question, let’s first talk about your vehicle. We’ve all been there. You’re driving to work and all of a
                                sudden, your car sputters to a halt. It’s your transmission. What do you do? It’s a tough spot to be in. You’re going to
                                need a new transmission, but it’s EXPENSIVE. Especially if you (like most of us) have limited savings! This is the
                                moment where you’re going to be thankful that you invested in a Vehicle Service Contract.

                                When you buy a vehicle through a dealer, it comes with a warranty that covers your car in case certain components fail.
                                Usually a manufacturer’s warranty lasts 3-4 years on a new vehicle. A Vehicle Service Contract is a contract through a
                                third party administrator that helps you to extend the coverage on your vehicle so that you can continue to have peace
                                of mind.
                                <br><br>
                                It doesn’t matter whether your car is new or used, when your manufacturer’s warranty expires, you no longer have
                                coverage in case something happens. If you’re still making payments on your used vehicle, it’s even more important to
                                look into the benefits of a Vehicle Service Contract. You don’t want to be making payments on a broken down vehicle
                                because you can’t afford the repair.

                                A Vehicle Service Contract or warranty covers the physical components of your vehicle that can eventually fail over time
                                due to normal wear and tear. Depending on the level of coverage you qualify for, a Vehicle Service Contract can cover
                                standard things like transmissions, seals & gaskets, and fluids, all the way up to your air conditioning, GPS navigation
                                system and exterior.

                                Vehicle Service Contracts are fully transferable and prorated, meaning that if you sell your car during the contract
                                period, you can cancel and receive a prorated refund based on time and mileage not used. It is also transferable, so it
                                will help increase the resale value of your vehicle should you decide to sell.

                                    One of the very first questions you must ask yourself when considering a Vehicle Service Contract is what your vehicle
                                    is actually worth.
                                    <br><br>
                                    A good place to start is the Kelley Blue Book. They can give you a pretty good estimate of what your vehicle is worth,
                                    by simply submitting some basic information into their online form.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Once you know how much your vehicle is worth, you can make an informed decision about whether or not that investment is
                                    worth protecting. If your vehicle breaks down, is it worth it to you to pay the out of pocket cost?

                                    With a Vehicle Service Contract, you can significantly lower the cost of repairs by being covered in case something goes
                                    wrong. Instead of gambling on a costly repair, you will have peace of mind that you’re covered and won’t have any
                                    outrageous out of pocket expenses moving forward.

                                    The average transmission costs anywhere between $2,000 and $6,000. The average Vehicle Service Contract
                                    deductible is
                                    between $0 and $100! That’s a big difference!

                                    it’s not an out of pocket cost from your purchase of a Vehicle Service Contract. However, it does help
                                    illustrate how
                                    useful having a VSC is in terms of lowering your bottom line, should you need repairs.

                                    People often wonder how important it really is to keep up with oil changes. The short answer is that it is very
                                    important. Not only is it a mandatory condition of your Vehicle Service Contract, regular oil changes are a way to
                                    protect your vehicle from wear and tear.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Engines are made up of many moving parts and in order for those parts to function properly and avoid damage, they need
                                    to be well lubricated. Keeping up with oil and filter changes can help you avoid costly repairs down the road. Over
                                    time, your engine’s oil breaks down and becomes contaminated with debris such as dust and dirt that can have an impact
                                    on the oil’s ability to lubricate your engine’s parts.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Regular oil changes help you to maintain proper engine lubrication, which helps cool engine components and prevents
                                    damage and over-heating of the engine due to friction. As it provides lubrication, it also helps clear dirt, engine wear
                                    and sludge from broken down oil in your engine. When you keep up with your oil and filter changes, it can help remove
                                    these particles that naturally build up over time.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Another wonderful advantage of properly keeping up with oil and filter changes is that it can improve your vehicle’s gas
                                    mileage. According to the US Department of Energy, you can improve your gas mileage by 1-2% by using the manufacturer’s

                                When you purchase your Vehicle Service Contract, you are entering into a contract with an Administrator. The
                                Administrator is the company that is responsible for paying out your claims. Any reputable Administrator is going to be
                                insured. In order to assure that they will honor the terms of your contract, it must be backed by insurance.

                                If the Administrator is not insured and goes out of business for any reason, you’re basically left with an expensive
                                piece of paper instead of a contract. The insurance company is the one that makes sure that your claims are paid no
                                matter what happens with the Administrator during the term of your contract.
